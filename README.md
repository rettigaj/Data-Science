# Data-Science
This is a repository for my data science labs that I use for my lower level class.

Initually, I created them for Docker, because who doesn't love docker.  But my next version is just going to be google colab.

If anyone wants to expand them, that would be amazing.  We could also put them in Latex which would make sense.
